#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The time complexity of A is O(n) because of the use of the while loop.  


b) The time complexity of B is O(n^2) because of the while loop within the for loop.


c) The time complexity of C is O(n) because the function is recursive. 

## Exercise II

Make a function, call it throwing eggs, that takes in a parameter of f. 
In that function we need an for loop. For each floor in the building, if that floor is f or is higher than f return false for broken. if the floor is lower than f return true for unbroken.  

The runtime complexity of this the throwing eggs function would be O(n^2) due to the if statement within for loop.
