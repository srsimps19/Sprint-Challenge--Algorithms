#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The time complexity of A is O(n^2) because of the use of multiplication.  


b) The time complexity of B is O(n) because of the for loop.


c) The time complexity of C is O(1) or constant time because even though there is an if statement the complexity of what is inside the statement is constant time. 

## Exercise II
