#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The time complexity of A is O(n^2) because of the use of multiplication.  


b) The time complexity of B is O(n) because of the for loop.


c) The time complexity of C is O(1) or constant time because even though there is an if statement the complexity of what is inside the statement is constant time. 

## Exercise II

Make a function, call it throwing eggs. 
In that function we need an for loop. For each floor in the building, if that floor is higher than ground floor throw egg. return false for broken and true for unbroken.  

The runtime complexity of this the throwing eggs function would be O(n) due to the for loop.
